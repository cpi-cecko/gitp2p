gitp2p Overview
===============

There are 3 components in gitp2p - gitp2p-remote-helper, gitp2p-relay and
gitp2pd.

The job of gitp2p-remote-helper is to provide the protocol with which git
would transfer objects around. The job of gitp2p-relay is to provide centralized
site for peers. In it there's up-to-date info about each repo with its peers'
address, id and latest refs. gitp2pd is the daemon controlling each peer.

Upon creating a new repository or cloning an existing one, each peer can
subscribe to gitp2p-relay. (TODO: How we subscribe?) After that, on each repo
update, the peer MUST send its latest refs to gitp2p-relay in order to update
the info in the database. The latest refs DB is currently a main component in
the mechanism for determining how ahead is each repository and what to fetch
each peer.
