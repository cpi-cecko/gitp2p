Documentation About gitp2p List Capability
==========================================

Overview
--------

During `list' gitp2p-remote-helper first looks for the latest ref it has for
each branch/tag. It then sends this info to gitp2p-relay. The relay keeps a DB
with all peers and their respective repositories' latest refs. It queries this
DB and compiles a list containing each ref and the accumulated sha1 ids of the
peers' refs. This list is sent to each peer. Each peer has to filter out every
id that it doesn't have. It then sends back the ids it does have. The relay
gets the unique refs from this list and ensures that for each ref there's only
one ref. **This should be the case if the latest ref DB is consistently
updated after each fetch/push** It then sends this list back to
gitp2p-remote-helper and the helper echoes it to git.
