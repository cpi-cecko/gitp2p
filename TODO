Current:
1. Heartbeating:
    -- Between relay and peers
    -- Between peers during fetch
2. Data determination algorithm
    -- What happens when a peer dies during transfer?
3. Go through TODOs
4. Testing of fetch functionality
    -- By hand
    -- Using a test suite

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. gitp2p-config gets moved a lot
2. Torrent tracker web interface
3. Repo for signed docs
4. Don't unpack packs!
5. Handshake before connections
6. Handle alternatives
7. After discovery of the initial network peer, we should be able to rely on
   peers instead of a relay.
8. Trusted updates of branches and tags
9. Uniquely identifiable repositories
10. Object transfer
    - Pack files limited in size, generated on-the-fly
    - Big objects
    - Advertising list of available pack files and determining what a peer 
      needs
11. Cloning a repo while peer has a partial info about it
12. Prioritize rare pieces
13. Metainfo file
14. Make the relay just a peer? A peer could opt for being a relay via some
    config file. Each relay-peer could have some kind of trust points.
15. Tool to collect statistics about the network - repos, active peers, etc.
16. Peer impersonation exploit
17. Pruning inactive peers
